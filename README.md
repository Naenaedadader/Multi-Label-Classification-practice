# Multi-Label-Classification-practice

Using resnet50 doing Multi-Label Classification

Using PASCAL dataset which download from Pattern Analysis, Statical Modeling and Computational Learning

First download the PASCAL dataset

Second setup what ur dataloader how to get x and y. Here x for image path, y for label

Third train model using resnet50 and metrics using accuracy_multi cause it has more than one label.

Final plot out tresh and accuracy and find out which tresh has the better accuracy.
